\opening{Dear Mr. Alcozer,}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the administrative assistant position at your Partnership. My combination of personal skills, work ethic, and technical capabilities---including graduate-level training in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning---would make me a valuable addition to your Practice.

I bring essential qualities for legal administrative support: persistence, attention to detail, and sound judgment. I am an attentive listener who exercises discretion and communicates effectively with clients. I am capable of taking detailed notes during meetings and consultations, and I have a verifiable typing speed of 58 words per minute with 98\% accuracy. I am prepared to become a Texas-certified notary public shortly after being hired.

\textbf{AI-Enhanced Legal Support:} As a Master's student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Texas Tech University, I am uniquely positioned to help your Practice leverage AI tools responsibly and in full compliance with Texas Bar guidance, including Professional Ethics Committee Opinion 705. I understand the ethical obligations surrounding generative AI in legal practice: maintaining technological competence, independently verifying AI-generated outputs, protecting client confidentiality, and ensuring fair and ethical billing practices.

I can assist your Practice with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI Tool Vetting \& Procurement:} Evaluating AI solutions for reliability, security, and compliance with data privacy standards before implementation
    \item \textbf{Document Preparation:} Leveraging AI to accelerate contract review, legal research summaries, and document drafting---always with rigorous human verification
    \item \textbf{Data Security Compliance:} Implementing best practices for data minimization, anonymization, and vendor due diligence to protect client confidentiality
    \item \textbf{Policy Development:} Assisting in establishing internal AI usage policies that align with TDRPC ethical guidelines
    \item \textbf{Operational Efficiency:} Streamlining client intake, scheduling, timekeeping, and billing processes through thoughtful AI integration
    \item \textbf{MCP Server Development:} Creating and demonstrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs to answer questions about your internal business accounts and systems in plain English, transforming how your Practice interacts with proprietary data through natural language queries
\end{itemize}

While I understand my duties will be in administrative support, I would like you you to know that my lack of experience as an administrative assistant is not a reflection on my ability to perform the duties of the position. I am a quick learner and I am confident that I can learn the necessary skills to perform the duties of the position, and my technical expertise will be a valuable asset for tasks in ways that are not yet defined.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my AI expertise can responsibly enhance administrative productivity, improve client engagement and results, while upholding the highest ethical standards. 

Thank you for considering my application.


\closing{Respectfully yours,}

\end{letter}
