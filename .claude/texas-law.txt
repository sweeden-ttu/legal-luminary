<p class="intro-text">
Texas has a unique legal system with specific statutes, procedures, and penalties that differ from other states. Understanding these laws is essential whether you're facing criminal charges or pursuing a civil claim.
</p>

## Texas Criminal Law Overview

The Texas Penal Code classifies criminal offenses into categories based on severity. Understanding these classifications helps you understand what you may be facing and the importance of proper legal representation.

### Felony Classifications

<div class="info-box">
<h4>Capital Felony</h4>
<p>The most serious offense in Texas, punishable by life imprisonment without parole or death. Examples include capital murder.</p>
</div>

**First Degree Felony** — Punishment ranges from 5 to 99 years or life in prison, plus fines up to $10,000. Examples include aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury, aggravated robbery, and certain domestic violence offenses.

**Second Degree Felony** — Punishment ranges from 2 to 20 years in prison, plus fines up to $10,000. Examples include aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and robbery.

**Third Degree Felony** — Punishment ranges from 2 to 10 years in prison, plus fines up to $10,000. Examples include certain assault offenses against public servants.

**State Jail Felony** — Punishment ranges from 180 days to 2 years in a state jail facility, plus fines up to $10,000.

### Misdemeanor Classifications

**Class A Misdemeanor** — Up to 1 year in county jail and/or fines up to $4,000. Many assault charges fall into this category.

**Class B Misdemeanor** — Up to 180 days in county jail and/or fines up to $2,000.

**Class C Misdemeanor** — Fine only, up to $500. No jail time, but still creates a criminal record.

## Texas Personal Injury Law

Texas follows a "modified comparative fault" system for personal injury claims. Understanding this system is crucial for anyone pursuing compensation for injuries.

### Key Principles

<ul class="check-list">
<li><strong>Statute of Limitations</strong> — Generally 2 years from the date of injury to file a lawsuit</li>
<li><strong>Comparative Fault</strong> — You can recover damages if you are less than 51% at fault</li>
<li><strong>Damage Caps</strong> — Certain non-economic damages may be capped in specific cases</li>
<li><strong>Workers' Compensation</strong> — Texas has unique rules for workplace injuries</li>
</ul>

### Types of Compensable Damages

When you're injured due to another's negligence, Texas law may allow you to recover:

**Economic Damages** include medical expenses (past and future), lost wages, loss of earning capacity, and property damage.

**Non-Economic Damages** include pain and suffering, mental anguish, physical impairment, disfigurement, and loss of consortium.

**Punitive Damages** may be awarded in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, though Texas caps these awards in most cases.

## Your Rights Under Texas Law

<div class="info-box">
<h4>Constitutional Protections</h4>
<p>Both the U.S. Constitution and Texas Constitution protect your rights throughout legal proceedings. These include the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, the right to a speedy trial, and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
</div>

### If You're Accused of a Crime

You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney, and if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed. You have the right to know the charges against you and to confront witnesses. Understanding and exercising these rights is critical.

### If You've Been Injured

You have the right to seek compensation from those responsible for your injuries. Insurance companies may contact you quickly after an accident; you are not required to give recorded statements. Consulting with an attorney before speaking with insurance adjusters protects your interests.
