Many misconceptions surround Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits. Understanding the truth helps Texans navigate the system more effectively.

## Myth 1: First Claims Are Automatically Denied

While many initial applications face rejection, approximately one in four first-time applicants successfully obtain benefits. The outcome depends heavily on application quality and medical documentation rather than automatic denial.

## Myth 2: Complete Work Incapacity Is Required

According to the Social Security Administration's definition, disability means inability to perform "substantial gainful activity" due to a medical condition lasting 12+ months. Applicants need not be entirely work-incapable; they simply must be unable to perform their previous work or other available work considering age, education, and experience.

## Myth 3: Workers' Compensation Excludes SSD Benefits

Applicants can simultaneously receive both SSD and Workers' Compensation. However, an "offset" may reduce Social Security benefits to prevent exceeding combined benefit limits.

## Myth 4: The Application Process Is Quick

The application process typically requires several months for initial decisions, with appeals potentially extending timelines for years due to medical record reviews and application volume.

## Myth 5: Attorney Representation Is Unnecessary

While technically optional, applicants with legal representation experience significantly higher approval rates. Attorneys help gather evidence, complete paperwork, understand SSA definitions, represent during hearings, and avoid common denial pitfalls.
