The holiday shopping season brings increased foot traffic to Texas retail establishments. Understanding premises liability rights is essential for customers who suffer injuries while shopping.

## Texas Premises Liability Law

Store customers are considered "invitees" under Texas law, meaning retailers must maintain reasonably safe premises. This responsibility includes identifying hazards, conducting inspections, and warning of non-obvious dangers.

## Immediate Actions After an Injury

Those injured in a retail store should take these critical steps:

1. **Seek medical attention immediately**
2. **Report the incident to store management**
3. **Document the scene with photos**
4. **Collect witness information**
5. **Avoid admitting fault**
6. **Preserve evidence like damaged clothing**

## Legal Timeline and Potential Damages

Texas allows injured parties two years from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit. Potential recoverable damages include:

- Medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Pain and suffering
- Other compensation depending on case specifics

## Why Prompt Action Matters

Delayed action can compromise evidence gathering and case strength, despite the two-year window appearing generous. An experienced personal injury attorney can help navigate complex claims while injured individuals focus on recovery.
