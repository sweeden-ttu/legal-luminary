## 💡 Site Branding, Color Theme, and Font

Whenever creating new pages, blog posts or UI functionality, developers and engineers should follow the style and branding guidelines below.

### Visual Elements

- Scales of Justice with embedded AI nodes (glowing blue circles) symbolizing the fusion of legal tradition and AI technology
- Texas Lone Star prominently displayed in gold, reinforcing the Central Texas identity
- Deep navy blue background with subtle circuit patterns conveying technological sophistication
- Golden accents providing a classic, prestigious legal aesthetic

### Typography

Title headings should be elegant serif font with gold gradient
Sections and subsections should be a modern sans-serif with tech-blue glow
Metadata and footers should have a supporting tagline for Texas attorneys

### Color Palette

The main colors of the site are below, however, pages and UI elements are not limited to only these colors:

- Navy/midnight blue (#0a1628 to #1a2744) Representing professionalism and trust
- Gold (#d4af37 to #f4d03f)  Representing prestige and legal tradition
- Cyan blue (#4da6ff) Representing AI and technology

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment. The workflow:

- Builds on pushes to the `main` branch
- Uses Ruby 3.3 with bundler caching
- Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Setting Your Site URL

Edit `_config.yml`:

```yaml
# For GitHub Pages project site:
baseurl: "/legal-luminary"
url: "https://sweeden-ttu.github.io"

# For custom domain:
baseurl: ""
url: "https://www.legalluminary.com"
```

> **Note:** When using GitHub Actions, the `baseurl` is automatically set by the workflow.

### Custom Domain Setup

1. Create a `CNAME` file in the root with your domain:
   ```
   www.yourdomain.com
   ```
2. Configure DNS with your registrar:
   - **A records** pointing to GitHub's IPs
   - **CNAME record** pointing to `sweeden-ttu.github.io`
3. Enable HTTPS in repository Settings → Pages

| File | Used On |
|------|---------|
| `ads-defense.html` | Defense attorneys page |
| `ads-injury.html` | Personal injury page |
| `ads-general.html` | Homepage and other pages |

### Adding Content

Pages use front matter to configure layout and sidebar ads:

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: "Page Title"
permalink: /page-url/
sidebar_ads: defense    # Options: defense, injury, or omit for general
hero: true
hero_title: "Hero Section Title"

## 📝 Content Guidelines: Third-Person Wording

### Why Third-Person is Required

**This website must use third-person impersonal wording throughout all content.** This is a critical requirement for several important reasons:

#### 1. AI Tool, Not Legal Advice Provider

This website is an **AI-enhanced legal information tool** that assists attorneys and their clients. It does **not** replace attorneys or provide direct legal advice. Using third-person wording (e.g., "individuals," "clients," "those who") rather than second-person ("you," "your") clearly establishes that:

- The content is informational and educational, not personalized legal advice
- The site serves as a resource tool, not a direct service provider
- Users should consult with licensed attorneys for advice specific to their situations

#### 2. Professional Distance and Objectivity

Third-person wording maintains appropriate professional distance and objectivity, which is essential for:

- **Attorneys using the site** as a resource for their clients
- **Clients reviewing information** before or after attorney consultations
- **Maintaining clear boundaries** between informational content and legal representation

#### 3. Compliance and Liability Protection

Using third-person impersonal language helps protect against:

- Unintended formation of attorney-client relationships
- Misinterpretation of general information as specific legal advice
- Claims that the website provides direct legal services

#### 4. Target Audience Clarity

The primary audience includes both:
- **Attorneys** who may reference this site when discussing cases with clients
- **Clients** who are researching legal topics before or during attorney consultations

Third-person wording accommodates both audiences without creating confusion about who is being addressed.

### Implementation Guidelines

When creating or editing content:

✅ **DO use:**
- "Individuals," "clients," "residents," "those who"
- "Their," "they," "them"
- "One's" (when appropriate)
- Impersonal constructions: "When facing charges..." instead of "When you face charges..."

❌ **DON'T use:**
- "You," "your," "you're"
- Direct address: "You should consult..." → "Individuals should consult..."
- Personal commands: "Contact an attorney" → "Individuals should contact an attorney"

### Examples

**Before (Second-Person):**
> "If you're facing criminal charges, you should understand your rights. You have the right to an attorney, and if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed."

**After (Third-Person):**
> "If individuals are facing criminal charges, they should understand their rights. They have the right to an attorney, and if they cannot afford one, one will be appointed."

**Before (Second-Person):**
> "When you've been injured due to someone else's negligence, you shouldn't have to bear the financial burden alone."

**After (Third-Person):**
> "When individuals have been injured due to someone else's negligence, they shouldn't have to bear the financial burden alone."

### Files Requiring Third-Person Wording

All content files must maintain third-person wording:
- `_pages/*.md` - All page content
- `_layouts/*.html` - Layout templates with content
- `_includes/*.html` - Include files with content
- Any new content files added to the site

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

1. Check the **Actions** tab for error logs
2. Ensure `Gemfile.lock` is committed
3. Verify Ruby version compatibility (3.3+ recommended)

### Local Development Issues

```bash
# Clear Jekyll cache
bundle exec jekyll clean

# Rebuild with verbose output
bundle exec jekyll build --trace

# Check for config errors
bundle exec jekyll doctor
```

### CSS Not Loading

- Verify `baseurl` is set correctly
- Check that asset paths use `{{ '/path' | relative_url }}`

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence in Legal Practice

### About Legal Luminary

Legal Luminary is an AI-powered tool designed to assist law students, attorneys, and paralegals with real and verified legal information. The platform prioritizes client privacy and discretion above all else, ensuring that sensitive legal matters remain confidential while providing powerful AI assistance for legal research, case preparation, and educational support.

### Common AI Tools Assisting Attorneys Today

The legal profession has rapidly adopted artificial intelligence tools to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Some of the most common AI tools currently assisting attorneys include:

- **Legal Research Platforms**: AI-powered research tools like Westlaw Edge and LexisNexis use natural language processing to find relevant case law, statutes, and legal precedents more quickly than traditional keyword searches.

- **Document Review and E-Discovery**: Tools such as Relativity and Everlaw use machine learning to analyze thousands of documents, identify relevant information, and flag privileged communications during the discovery process.

- **Contract Analysis**: AI platforms like Kira Systems and LawGeex can review contracts, identify key terms, extract clauses, and compare documents against standard templates, significantly reducing review time.

- **Legal Writing Assistants**: Tools like Casetext's CoCounsel and Harvey AI help attorneys draft briefs, memos, and other legal documents by providing research-backed suggestions and citations.

- **Predictive Analytics**: AI systems analyze historical case data to predict case outcomes, settlement values, and judge behavior, helping attorneys make more informed strategic decisions.

- **Client Communication**: Chatbots and AI assistants handle initial client intake, answer frequently asked questions, and schedule consultations, allowing attorneys to focus on complex legal work.

- **Compliance Monitoring**: AI tools continuously monitor regulatory changes and alert attorneys to updates that may affect their clients or practice areas.

### Legal Luminary: Five Unique Features

Legal Luminary distinguishes itself from other AI legal tools through the following innovative features:

1. **Canvas LMS Integration for Law Schools**: Legal Luminary seamlessly integrates with Instructure Canvas, the learning management system used by many law schools. This integration allows law students to access verified legal information directly within their course environment, making research and study more efficient. The integration repository is available at `/Users/sdw/Documents/gh/canvas-lms-mcp`, enabling any law school using Canvas to connect Legal Luminary to their learning platform.

2. **Verified Information Architecture**: Unlike general-purpose AI tools that may generate unverified content, Legal Luminary is built on a foundation of verified legal information. The platform cross-references multiple authoritative legal databases to ensure accuracy and reliability, reducing the risk of citing incorrect or outdated legal precedents.

3. **Privacy-First Design**: Client privacy and discretion are paramount in Legal Luminary's architecture. The platform employs end-to-end encryption, does not store client-specific case information, and operates with strict data retention policies. Attorneys can use the tool with confidence that sensitive client matters remain confidential.

4. **Educational Focus for Law Students**: While many AI legal tools target practicing attorneys, Legal Luminary includes specialized features for law students, including case brief generation, study guides, and integration with academic coursework. The Canvas integration allows students to access these features within their existing learning workflow.

5. **Context-Aware Legal Research**: Legal Luminary understands the context of legal questions and provides more relevant results by considering jurisdiction, practice area, and case type. This context awareness reduces the time attorneys spend filtering through irrelevant search results and helps law students understand how legal concepts apply in different scenarios.

### Canvas LMS Integration

Legal Luminary can plug into any law school using Instructure Canvas, providing students and faculty with AI-powered legal research and study assistance directly within the Canvas learning environment. The integration is built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and allows for seamless access to verified legal information without leaving the Canvas interface.
