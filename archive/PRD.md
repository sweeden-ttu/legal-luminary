# Legal Luminary - Central Texas Political Candidate Site

## Project Overview

A professional Jekyll static site for Central Texas (Bell County) political candidates. The site organizes candidates by **jurisdiction/office/role** (incumbent vs challenger), provides navigation with breadcrumbs, and enforces quality standards (headshots, verified sources) before publishing.

## User stories

### US-001: Elections hub with breadcrumbs and sub-navigation

**Priority**: 1  
**Status**: pending  

**User Story**: As a voter I want an Elections area with breadcrumbs and sub-navigation from city through office so I can find races and candidates without hunting unrelated pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-001.1 An elections landing page exists with breadcrumb Home then Elections.
- [ ] AC-001.2 Each city under _cities exposes an index and links to office sections with consistent URL patterns.
- [ ] AC-001.3 Office pages list incumbent versus challenger grouping where applicable and link to candidate dossiers.

### US-002: Publish gates for candidate dossiers

**Priority**: 1  
**Status**: pending  

**User Story**: As an editor I want candidate pages to stay draft until headshot and minimum sources exist so we do not publish incomplete profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-002.1 Front matter or data files encode headshot path or placeholder policy and at least two cited sources with URL and retrieved date before published true.
- [ ] AC-002.2 Candidates failing gates remain draft or excluded from production collections.
- [ ] AC-002.3 verification_status values are documented and enforced in layouts or generators.

### US-003: Structured candidate data under _data and content trees

**Priority**: 2  
**Status**: pending  

**User Story**: As a maintainer I want candidate JSON and markdown organized by jurisdiction office and role so Jekyll collections and Liquid stay maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-003.1 _data candidates mirror the on-disk taxonomy described in Project Overview or successor layout notes.
- [ ] AC-003.2 Slugs are stable URL-safe and unique across the site.
- [ ] AC-003.3 Adding a new candidate follows a documented path in README or AGENTS notes.

### US-004: Election news and dates from allowlisted sources

**Priority**: 2  
**Status**: pending  

**User Story**: As a reader I want recent Central Texas election-related updates with provenance so dates and events stay current without unsourced claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-004.1 News ingest uses only allowlisted RSS official clerk or city URLs or hand-curated bundles committed to the repo.
- [ ] AC-004.2 Posts or feed data include source URL and retrieved timestamp.
- [ ] AC-004.3 Election dates surfaced on hub or office pages match ingested metadata or show unknown explicitly.

### US-005: Green Jekyll build and regression checks

**Priority**: 2  
**Status**: pending  

**User Story**: As a release owner I want jekyll build and scripted checks to pass so broken internal links or missing layouts cannot ship.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-005.1 bundle exec jekyll build or the repo build script completes without error on a clean checkout after documented setup.
- [ ] AC-005.2 HTML or link checks configured in CI or scripts pass for candidate and elections routes.
- [ ] AC-005.3 sitemap and primary navigation include new elections routes when those pages exist.
