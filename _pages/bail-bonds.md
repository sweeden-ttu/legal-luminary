## Understanding Bail Bonds

When someone is arrested, a judge sets a bail amount that must be paid for them to be released from jail while awaiting trial. Most people don't have the full bail amount available in cash. That's where bail bonds companies step in.

### How Bail Bonds Work

A bail bond is a financial guarantee to the court that the defendant will appear for all required court dates. When working with a bail bonds company:

1. **Individuals pay a percentage** of the total bail amount (typically 10-15% in Texas)
2. **The bondsman posts the full bail** to secure release
3. **The defendant is released** from jail
4. **If the defendant appears** for all court dates, the bail is returned to the bondsman and individuals typically forfeit only the fee they paid
5. **If the defendant fails to appear**, individuals may be responsible for additional costs
