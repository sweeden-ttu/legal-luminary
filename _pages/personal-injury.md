<p class="intro-text">
When individuals have been injured due to someone else's negligence, they shouldn't have to bear the financial burden alone. Texas law provides avenues for compensation, but insurance companies work hard to minimize what they pay. Understanding rights is the first step toward fair recovery.
</p>

## Types of Personal Injury Cases

Personal injury law covers a wide range of situations where someone's negligence or wrongful conduct causes harm to another. The following are common types of cases handled by injury attorneys in Bell County:

### Motor Vehicle Accidents

<div class="info-box">
<h4>Texas is an At-Fault State</h4>
<p>Texas uses a fault-based system for car accidents. The driver who caused the accident (or their insurance) is responsible for damages. Individuals may recover compensation from the at-fault driver's liability insurance or through their own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.</p>
</div>

Car accidents on I-35, Highway 190, and other busy Bell County roads frequently cause serious injuries. Common causes include distracted driving, speeding, failure to yield, and commercial vehicle negligence. Compensation may include medical expenses, lost wages, vehicle damage, and pain and suffering.

### Premises Liability

Property owners have a duty to maintain safe conditions. When they fail, injuries result:

**Apartment Complex Negligence** — Inadequate security leading to assault or robbery. Poorly maintained common areas causing falls. Failure to address known hazards. Negligent maintenance of stairways, pools, and parking areas.

**Commercial Property** — Slip and fall accidents. Inadequate lighting or security. Defective conditions. Negligent maintenance.

**Residential Property** — Dog bites. Swimming pool accidents. Dangerous conditions.

### Workplace Injuries

<div class="info-box">
<h4>Workers' Compensation in Texas</h4>
<p>Texas is unique — employers can opt out of workers' compensation. If an individual's employer is a "non-subscriber," they may sue them directly for negligence, potentially recovering more than workers' comp would provide. Even with workers' comp, individuals may have third-party claims against equipment manufacturers or other responsible parties.</p>
</div>

**On-the-Job Injuries** include construction accidents, industrial machinery injuries, repetitive stress injuries, exposure to harmful substances, and transportation accidents during work.

**Fort Cavazos Civilian Workers** — Civilian employees at military installations have specific rights and procedures for workplace injuries.

### Disability Claims

When injuries prevent individuals from working:

**Social Security Disability** — Federal program for those unable to work due to disability lasting at least 12 months.

**Long-Term Disability Insurance** — Claims against private disability policies through employers or individual coverage.

**Veterans Disability** — VA disability claims for service-connected conditions.

## What Compensation May Be Available

<ul class="check-list">
<li><strong>Medical Expenses</strong> — Past and future treatment, rehabilitation, medications</li>
<li><strong>Lost Income</strong> — Wages lost during recovery and reduced future earning capacity</li>
<li><strong>Pain and Suffering</strong> — Physical pain and emotional distress</li>
<li><strong>Property Damage</strong> — Vehicle repair or replacement, damaged personal items</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Enjoyment</strong> — Inability to participate in activities individuals previously enjoyed</li>
<li><strong>Disfigurement</strong> — Scarring or permanent physical changes</li>
</ul>

## Why Individuals Need a Personal Injury Attorney

### Insurance Companies Are Not Their Friends

Insurance adjusters contact individuals quickly after an accident. Their goal is to settle cheaply. Tactics include taking recorded statements that can be used against individuals, offering quick settlements before the full extent of injuries is known, disputing medical treatment as unnecessary, and claiming individuals were partially at fault.

### An Attorney Levels the Playing Field

**Investigation** — Gathering evidence, obtaining police reports, interviewing witnesses, working with accident reconstructionists.

**Medical Documentation** — Ensuring injuries are properly documented and individuals receive appropriate treatment.

**Valuation** — Calculating the true value of claims including future damages.

**Negotiation** — Dealing with insurance companies from a position of knowledge and strength.

**Litigation** — Filing suit and taking cases to trial if a fair settlement isn't offered.

## Time Limits Apply

<div class="legal-notice">
<strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> In Texas, individuals generally have <strong>two years</strong> from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit. Missing this deadline typically bars claims forever. Some claims have shorter deadlines. Individuals should not delay in consulting an attorney.
</div>

## Take the First Step

Most personal injury attorneys offer free consultations and work on contingency — meaning individuals pay no attorney fees unless they recover compensation. There's no financial risk in learning about options.
