<p class="intro-text">
When individuals have been injured due to someone else's negligence, they shouldn't have to bear the financial burden alone. Texas law provides avenues for compensation, but insurance companies work hard to minimize what they pay. Understanding rights is the first step toward fair recovery.
</p>

## Types of Personal Injury Cases

Personal injury law covers situations where someone's negligence causes harm to another. Common cases in Bell County include:

### Motor Vehicle Accidents

<div class="info-box">
<h4>Texas is an At-Fault State</h4>
<p>Texas uses a fault-based system. The driver who caused the accident (or their insurance) is responsible for damages. Individuals may recover compensation from the at-fault driver's liability insurance or through their own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.</p>
</div>

Car accidents on I-35, Highway 190, and other busy Bell County roads frequently cause serious injuries. Types include car accidents, truck and commercial vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents, bicycle accidents, pedestrian accidents, bus accidents, and drunk driving accidents (which may involve dram shop liability claims against establishments that over-served alcohol).

### Premises Liability

Property owners must maintain safe conditions. When they fail, injuries result from slip and fall accidents, inadequate security, defective conditions, negligent maintenance, dog bites, and swimming pool accidents.

### Workplace Injuries

<div class="info-box">
<h4>Workers' Compensation in Texas</h4>
<p>Texas is unique — employers can opt out of workers' compensation. If an individual's employer is a "non-subscriber," they may sue them directly for negligence, potentially recovering more than workers' comp would provide.</p>
</div>

Workplace injuries include construction accidents, industrial machinery injuries, repetitive stress injuries, exposure to harmful substances, and transportation accidents during work.

### Other Cases

**Catastrophic Injuries** — Life-altering injuries including traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, severe burns, amputations, and permanent disfigurement.

**Wrongful Death** — When negligence results in death, surviving family members may pursue claims for funeral expenses, lost financial support, loss of companionship, and mental anguish.

## What Compensation May Be Available

<ul class="check-list">
<li><strong>Medical Expenses</strong> — Past and future treatment, rehabilitation, medications</li>
<li><strong>Lost Income</strong> — Wages lost during recovery and reduced future earning capacity</li>
<li><strong>Pain and Suffering</strong> — Physical pain and emotional distress</li>
<li><strong>Property Damage</strong> — Vehicle repair or replacement, damaged personal items</li>
</ul>

## Why Individuals Need a Personal Injury Attorney

Insurance adjusters contact individuals quickly after an accident with the goal of settling cheaply. An attorney levels the playing field by investigating cases, gathering evidence, obtaining police reports, ensuring proper medical documentation, calculating true claim values, negotiating with insurance companies, and filing suit when necessary.

## Time Limits Apply

<div class="legal-notice">
<strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> In Texas, individuals generally have <strong>two years</strong> from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit. Missing this deadline typically bars claims forever. Individuals should not delay in consulting an attorney.
</div>

## Take the First Step

Most personal injury attorneys offer free consultations and work on contingency — meaning individuals pay no attorney fees unless they recover compensation. There's no financial risk in learning about options.
