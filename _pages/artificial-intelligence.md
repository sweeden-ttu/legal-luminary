# Trustworthy AI Legal and Governmental Content Validator

This project is part of **CS5374 Software Verification and Validation** at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu), Department of Computer Science. The project builds a **Trustworthy AI validation pipeline** that verifies legal and governmental content against authoritative Texas open data before any AI system presents it to users.

## The Problem: AI Hallucination in Legal Research

Large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly used to answer questions about legal and governmental matters, yet they frequently hallucinate or return outdated information. Invented judge names, non-existent laws, fabricated election details, or unverified court documents can cause serious harm: incorrect legal advice, misrepresentation of officials, and invalid citations presented as binding authority.

### Notable Cases & Studies

## Content Verification Architecture

The pipeline verifies content across seven domains using authoritative Texas sources:

| Content Type | Authoritative Texas Source | Verification Approach |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Legal/Government News** | Trust lists, NewsGuard, AllSides | URL and domain checks; cross-check with Texas agency press releases |
| **Judges** | Texas judicial directories, court rosters | Name and court match against official rosters |
| **Elected Officials** | data.texas.gov, data.capitol.texas.gov | Match names, offices, and terms to official datasets |
| **Elections & Opponents** | Capitol Data Portal (116+ datasets) | Certified filings and results; candidate/race verification |
| **Laws & Ordinances** | Texas Legislature, agency sites | Citation and text match against official code/statute datasets |
| **Court Documents** | Texas court datasets, e-filing metadata | Docket/case ID and document metadata validation |
| **Legal Templates** | Texas court form registries | Checksum and version validation against known good templates |

**Note:** Federal sources (CourtListener, PACER, FEC) are not used as primary authorities; the focus is on **Texas legal and governmental sources** via the Texas Open Data Portal and Capitol Data Portal.

---

## LangGraph Validation Pipeline

The system uses **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to implement validator agents that ingest, parse, and verify content at each stage.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Content Extraction** - Parse and normalize input content
2. **Schema Validation** - Verify required fields and data types
3. **Source Authority Check** - Validate against allowlist of authoritative domains
4. **Temporal Validation** - Verify timestamps are valid and current
5. **Content Verification** - Cross-reference with authoritative Texas databases
6. **Provenance Attribution** - Attach verification metadata to all outputs

### Key Features

- **Schema validation** at every stage
- **Source grounding** requirements before indexing
- **Pass/fail routing** with retry or escalation
- **Provenance metadata** on all outputs (source, date, verification status)
- Only content that passes verification is indexed and made available to downstream AI systems
